SIM4 C Programs

    sim4.c - Converts sim3.c to a general register machine.

The file extensions .sim1, .sim2, .sim3, and .sim4 are used to identify SIM machine
language programs designed to run on the corresponding SIM computer. The programs are:

SIM4 Programs

    sum1to10.sim4 - Sums numbers from 10 to 1 to illustrate use of the general registers
    reverse.sim4 - Inputs n numbers and outputs in reverse order to illustrate arrays
    mult.sim - inputs 2 numbers and outputs their product to illustrate functions
    addn.sim4 - Uses registers to implement readv2.sim3 more efficiently.
